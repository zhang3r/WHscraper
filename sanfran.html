market for educational software is a mess.  it’s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and it’s even harder for them to scale.  school districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they’re purchasing.  teachers know there’s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.<p>at clever, we’re working to change all that.  we provide schools with a free api and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  we’ve grown fast: after three and a half years, we’re moving data for a third of all k-12 students in america (20m kids), and 50,000 schools are using us to manage their education apps.  our goals are much bigger than that, though.  we want to be two things:<p>-a single place where schools can easily integrate, manage and analyze all the software they’re using, and<p>-a single identity that students can use to see everything they’ve learned across multiple apps.<p>we’re a team of 95 (40 engineers) based in downtown sf, and we’re looking for engineers who

love. using our sw, platform and services, an employer can pay doctors directly, saving a ton of money and making the employee experience amazing (with the testimonials to back it up).<p>the company is well-funded, ~two years old and growing very rapidly with massive sales traction (300x this past year and on pace for another order of magnitude this year). we punch well above our weight-class with experienced founders, 150+ team members (~ one quarter is engineering), and paying customers.</ul><hr><ul style='background-color:lightcoral'><span class="c00">pivotal | onsite sf, nyc, palo alto and many, many locations worldwide | engineers, designers, product managers, pre&#x2f;post-sales engineers, ops and others | visa &amp; relocation for right candidate<p>first things first. we look for aptitude over apis. it doesn&#x27;t matter whether your resumé says php or phd: if you&#x27;re smart, know some stuff and have empathy, we want to work with you.<p>pivotal&#x27;s goal is to change the way the world makes software and we kinda sorta <i>really mean it</i>. we&#x27;re broken into three basic divisions: pivotal labs (yes, <i>that</i> pivotal labs), pivotal cloud foundry and pivotal big data. rotations between divisions, temporarily or permanently, are possible.<p>we have offices in san francisco, new york city, santa monica, palo alto, seattle, boulder, denver, chicago, boston, washington dc, toronto, london, dublin, tokyo and sydney. we will soon be opening an office in berlin as well, with more to come. relocations, temporarily or permanently, are possible.<p>each of the three divisions has a constantly evolving and deliberately cross-pollinated culture. we are constantly thinking about how we work and how we can work more sensibly, effectively and enjoyably. right now we are particularly trying to grow in labs and cloud foundry.<p>-- <i>pivotal labs</i>, from which the company draws its name and cultural seed, helps clients to become better at development. for engineering we are religiously lean and agile. in practice that means we pair program and tdd every line of code from the outside. our product managers are fantastic at keeping products sharply focused, our designers are masters from users to pixels.<p>-- <i>cloud foundry</i> solves application deployment and management. we&#x27;re the main contributors to the cloud foundry project. we&#x27;re constantly improving the leading opensource paas -- our distribution has the fastest-growing sales of any opensource product <i>ever</i>.<p>it&#x27;s also the only paas i&#x27;d personally bet a company on. except for integrated upstream code, every line is pair programmed and tdd&#x27;d. we dogfood the cutting edge of the technology on our own commercial public cloud (pivotal web services). it works because we took the xp and lean dna of pivotal labs and scaled it up to build the best cloud platform bar none.<p>-- <i>generally</i><p>at our offices we have free breakfast, weekly tech talks, good benefits and competitive pay. ping pong is not mandatory, but it&#x27;s popular. i think west-coast ping pong is harder to beat, but east-coast style is more entertaining to watch. the beer fridge has more ipa than i prefer but i guess that&#x27;s life in paradise.<p>we can provide visa and relocation assistance. in the nyc office we have about 15 people from overseas, including australians like me.<p>you can apply through our website: <a href="http:&#x2f;&#x2f;pivotal.io&#x2f;careers" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2f;&#x2f;pivotal.io&#x2f;careers</a>. you can also email me at jchester+hn@pivotal.io to answer any questions you might have and potentially help me score one of our generous referral bonuses.<p>for what it&#x27;s worth, i&#x27;m just an engineer, so my

reese&#x27;s eggs are back on the shelves, but why do they bother taking them down? daylight reemerges when you leave work for like... twenty minutes. there is only one thing certain in this time of chaos: ncc group is constantly hiring security consultants from all backgrounds to join our team.<p>if you’re a tinkerer, you enjoy breaking more than building, or someone who wonders “why” and ends up down the rabbit hole 36 hours later with a disassembled air conditioning unit surrounding them... we’d love to hear from you! our process welcomes those with years of experience, as well as those with little to no direct experience in what we do.<p>the bottom line: if you love security and research, ncc group just may be a perfect fit for you.<p>what do we do exactly? penetration testing, security analysis, and cutting-edge research into current technologies and attacks (breaking things). you spend most of your day thinking about security systems and how they can break. you get to be creative and have a lot of freedom to be clever while learning new technologies at a very fast pace. engagements are usually 2-4 weeks long and in a year you will be exposed to 15-20 products and technology stacks. your work will typically initiate person-months of security improvements in products millions of people use. you will have access to senior engineers&#x2f;architects and your findings&#x2f;ideas will be heard by senior decision makers. you will have enormous impact in making the software people use safer.<p>all of our consultants are also security researchers, with

infrastructure, sales<p>hey there! allow us to introduce ourselves. we are expensify and we do &quot;expense reports that don&#x27;t suck!&quot; (google &quot;expensify&quot; to read more.) we&#x27;re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and i need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. i can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren&#x27;s call of distant riches. but only if you are all of the following:<p>- an incredibly hard worker, even when it&#x27;s not so fun. there is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. after all — we do the sucky work so our customers won&#x27;t need to. i need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- a cool person to be with. not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. in fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? this isn&#x27;t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. we&#x27;ve done cambodia, thailand, mexico, india, turkey, croatia, portugal and the philippines. where do you want to go next?<p>- super talented, in a general way. we&#x27;re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. on any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing&#x2f;designing&#x2f;building some new feature, etc. this is not a code monkey job — you&#x27;re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- specifically talented in a programming way (or if not, shoot as an email anyways!). you can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. you can switch on a dime between c++, php, bash, cron, html, css, javascript, jquery, dwoo, sql — not because you know them all, but because you&#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. if you&#x27;re this sort of person, you&#x27;ll know what i mean. if not, then this position isn&#x27;t for you. and there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing i can do would stop you from applying. that&#x27;s a problem because while i know you are awesome, it&#x27;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications i get from everyone else. so this is where i&#x27;m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so i don&#x27;t accidentally overlook you?<p>there are probably many ways to do that. but the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href="http:&#x2f;&#x2f;we.are.expensify.com&#x2f;apply"
