to lend to its customers and any accredited investor to invest in consumer loan portfolios.<p>insikt was born out of our realization that banks will not be the lenders of tomorrow – brands will. traditional banks, saddled with new rules and regulation, are no longer in the business of taking risk and making loans and cannot be relied on to deliver credit access and opportunity to the masses. instead, tomorrow’s lenders will be media companies, retailers and prominent brands that have deep relationships with their customers and want to step in to help their customers get a fair loan. but, to do it right, they need scoring, servicing, technology and capital — all of which are expensive and difficult to build. so, why build it if you don’t have to? this is the future of lending. any brand or company can be a lender. we’ve launched “lending as a service” (laas) to power this transformation. we are bringing together the best and brightest to solve real problems in the financial industry. we are looking for diverse talent across many different domains including designers, front end and back end development, product management, analytics and data science, credit, operations,

now the market for educational software is a mess.  it’s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and it’s even harder for them to scale.  school districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they’re purchasing.  teachers know there’s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.<p>at clever, we’re working to change all that.  we provide schools with a free api and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  we’ve grown fast: after three and a half years, we’re moving data for a third of all k-12 students in america (19m kids), and 49,000 schools are using us to manage their education apps.  our goals are much bigger than that, though.  we want to be two things:<p>-a single place where schools can easily manage and analyze all the software they’re using, and<p>-a single identity that students can use to see everything they’ve learned across multiple apps.<p>we’re a team of 90 (40 engineers) based in downtown sf, and we’re looking for engineers who enjoy working in (or would enjoy learning) go, python and coffeescript.  more generally, we want people who are sharp, adaptable, and passionate about improving the way education works for everyone.<p>right now we&#x27;re also particularly looking for a lead partner engineer: someone who&#x27;s excited to help developers on our platform build products that schools and teachers truly
